# Portfolio

## Description
    This application is my portfolio for potential clients to view and learn about me. I inserted a navigation bar at the top of the page for easier navigation. There are three sections on the page: About Me, My Work, and Contact Me. The "About Me" section contains information about me, including: where I am from, what I previously did for work, what I learned from those experiences, and my outlook for this career. The "My Work" section contains images of my previous work and links to the deployed sites. The last section, "Contact Me," contains links to my github, my email, and my phone number. There are hover elements inembedded for all links except the images. Here is a link to the deployed site- https://umhello2020.github.io/Module-2-Challenge/
